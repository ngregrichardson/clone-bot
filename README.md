# 🕵️ Clone Bot
A Discord bot that shadows a user in your Discord every day.

## 🤔 About

✅ Clones the user's avatar

✅ Copies the user's username and nickname

✅ Duplicates the user's activity

✅ Shadows the user's messages and reactions

## 📋 Usage

Unlike most other Discord bots, Clone Bot cannot be made publicly addable to servers with the click of a button. This is because the bot changes profile picture, name, and tag to match that of the person it is cloning. Copying the nickname can be done per-server, but the rest cannot. Clone Bot can, however, be self-hosted and managed by the server owner/admins.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository and run `yarn install`.
2. Create a [Discord bot application](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot).
3. [Add your bot to your server](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/adding-your-bot-to-servers.html#bot-invite-links)
4. Copy [your bot token](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#your-token).
5. Create a `.env` file in the root folder of the project.
6. Add `BOT_TOKEN="<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>"` to the file and save.
7. Run `yarn start` to start your bot.
